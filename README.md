System Analysis and Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. Liam would like a system to help students pass their driving test at their local DMV. The DriverPass system aims to train students to pass their driving test because too many people fail it at their local DMV. The system will provide better driver training than currently available by providing in-person training, online courses, and practice tests. The system will provide users with the tools and functionality to make reservations for behind-the-wheel training. 

# What did you do particularly well?

The DriverPass PowerPoint presentation does a great job of explaining the Business Design Document to various stakeholders of the DriverPass Project.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could improve a component of the DriverPass documentation, I would improve the functional and non-functional requirements of the Business Requirements Document. I would restructure the presentation of the requirements so that the document and requirements flow together and make it easier to visualize the requirements.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I followed the SDLC and the different phases to interpret the user's needs. I started with requirement determination and progressed from there.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I have learned a lot from the SDLC. I can apply the whole SDLC when developing programs. I can break up the criteria for a program to create and implement all the  SDLC phases planning, analysis, designing, building, and testing. Another element I learned from the SDLC is not to be afraid to fail, and small regulated failures are learning curves. I also realized the importance of communication between end-users, Product Owners, Developers, and Stakeholders. Communication plays a vital role in the success of a development project, and I hope to improve my communication skills throughout my journey.
